# Handwriting-Recognition-in-Keras
Built a Keras model that performs OCR Handwriting Recognition 

I used a standard machine learning model in the MNIST dataset, a collection of 70,000 handwriting samples with the numbers 0 to 9, My challenge was to predict which number each handwritten image represents. 

Each image is 28x28 greyscale pixels, so I treated each image like a 1D array or tensor. The model has a 98% accuracy and only misclassified images that even humans would have trouble with.
